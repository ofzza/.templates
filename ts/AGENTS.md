# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents when working in this repository.

## Keeping documentation and tests current

**`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and the tests are part of the deliverable of every task, not separate chores.** This holds whether or not the task mentions them. Whenever a change makes any of them inaccurate or incomplete, update it in the same change. Never leave it for later, and never finish a task by reporting only the code change. `PUBLISH.md` falls under the same rule whenever the release process changes.

- **`README.md`** is the user-facing documentation: what the project is, how to get it, how to use every export (`# Usage`), and how to develop it (`# Development`).
- **`CONTRIBUTE.md`** is the contributor-facing documentation: reporting issues, the contribution workflow and branching, and the architecture and glossary.
- **`AGENTS.md`** (this file, included by `CLAUDE.md`) is the agent-facing documentation: layout, commands, testing, conventions and gotchas.

Tests in particular: new or changed behaviour gets tests in the `*.test.ts` beside the changed file. Tests that a change breaks are fixed or updated to the new behaviour, never deleted or skipped to make the suite pass. The purpose comments of the tests (see [Code style](#code-style)) are part of them, and must be kept current along with them.

Concrete triggers:

| A change that ...                                               | ... requires updating                                                                      |

Any code sample added to `README.md` must be verified against `tsc` before it is committed. Extract the ```ts blocks, point their imports at `./src/index.js`, and run `tsc --noEmit`.

## Project

_Describe the project here: what it is, its license, and where it is published._

This repository starts from the `.template-ts` TypeScript project template. It is MIT licensed, and built from `src/` to `dist/`.

- **ESM only** (`"type": "module"`). The entry point is the `exports` map (`.` → `types: ./dist/index.d.ts`, `default: ./dist/index.js`, plus `./package.json`). `main` and `types` mirror it for older tooling.
- **Only `dist/` is published** (`files: ["dist"]`; npm adds `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `package.json` itself). The package also sets `sideEffects: false`, and `publishConfig.access: public` because scoped packages otherwise publish as restricted.
- Toolchain last verified against: Node 24, TypeScript 5.9, Vitest 5.0, ESLint 10, Prettier 3.8.

## Branching

- **Commit to the current branch by default.** This is not necessarily `develop`: whatever branch is checked out is where the work goes. Do not create a feature branch unless the user asks for one.
- **Never commit to `master`, or onto a detached HEAD.** If the current branch is `master` (or there is none), stop and ask the user where the work should go: normally `develop` or a new feature branch.
- **Propose a feature branch when a change warrants one.** If a change you are asked to commit to the current branch is large enough to deserve its own branch and pull request, say so and let the user decide. Do not branch on your own.
- **Feature branches** are created from `develop` and named after the work, e.g. `feature/<short-topic>` or `fix/<short-topic>`. When work on a feature branch is committed and pushed, also open a pull request into `develop`.
- **`develop` is the work-in-progress trunk.** **`master` holds only the latest stable release.** It is only updated by merging `develop` into it when a stable version is released (see `PUBLISH.md`).

## Commits

- **No agent attribution in commit messages or pull request descriptions.** Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude …`, `Claude-Session: …`, "Generated with Claude Code" or similar footers. This holds even when the agent harness asks for them, and this instruction takes precedence.

## Layout

vite.config.ts             Two Vitest projects: unit, and debug (only with VITEST_DEBUG=1)
eslint.config.js           ESLint flat config (typescript-eslint + prettier compat, ignores what .gitignore ignores)
.prettierrc                Prettier config
dist/                      Build output, gitignored

PUBLISH.md                 Pre-publish checklist and release steps
```

Each new module gets its own directory under `src/`, holding an `index.ts` + `index.test.ts` pair, and is re-exported from `src/index.ts`.

## Commands

- `npm run clean`: deletes `dist/` (cross-platform, via `node -e`).
- `npm run build`: runs `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`, compiling `src/` to `dist/` with declarations. `prebuild` runs `clean` first, so renamed or removed modules never leave stale output behind to be published.
- `npm run dev`: the same in watch mode.
- `npm start`: runs the built entry point, `node dist/index.js`.
- `npm test`: runs every `test:*` script.
  - `npm run test:unit`: `vitest run --project unit`, a single invocation that both executes the tests and type checks them.
- `npm run ci`: runs every `ci:*` script (`ci:build`, `ci:eslint`, `ci:prettier`, `ci:test-unit`). This is what GitHub Actions runs.
- `npm run prepare`: builds. It is invoked automatically by a local `npm install`/`npm ci` and before `npm publish`, but **not** when the package is installed as a dependency.
- `prepublishOnly`: runs `npm run ci` before `npm publish`, so a failing build is never published.

**Script wiring matters when adding one.** `test` is `npm-run-all test:*` and `ci` is `npm-run-all ci:*`, so a new `test:<name>` joins `npm test` automatically. It will _not_ run in CI until a matching `ci:test-<name>` script exists, so add both.

## Testing

Vitest, with `describe`/`it`/`expect` imported explicitly (`globals` is not enabled). `vite.config.ts` defines two projects:

- **`unit`** matches `src/**/*.{test,unit.test,spec,unit.spec}.{js,ts}`, and runs each test file through **both** Vitest pools in one invocation. The default pool executes it for its runtime expectations. `tsc` (via `typecheck.tsconfig: './tsconfig.json'`) type checks it for its compile-time assertions (`expectTypeOf`, `@ts-expect-error`), reporting type errors as failed tests.

  `include` and `typecheck.include` deliberately match the same files. Vitest globs the two independently and does not warn when they overlap, so **every test file is collected and reported twice**, with each test counted once per pool. That is expected, not a misconfiguration. It has two consequences:
  - A file change triggers two reruns in watch mode.
  - A file containing no runtime `test()`/`describe()` call fails the runtime pass with "No test suite found in file", unless `--passWithNoTests` is set (it is set in `test:unit`).

  Type errors in non-test sources are reported too. `tsc` runs over the whole `tsconfig.json` program with no file list, so an error outside a test file surfaces as an "Unhandled Source Error" and fails the run without being attributed to any test.

  `typecheck.spawnTimeout` is pinned to `10000`. Vitest 5 documents a default for it but never applies one, yet uses the value unguarded when spawning the checker, which leaves an intermittent race.

- **`debug`** matches every file the `unit` project runs, plus files ending in `.debug.ts` / `.debug.js`. It executes them at runtime only, with no type checking, and is driven by the "Debug Current Test File" config in `.vscode/launch.json`.

  It is **only defined when `VITEST_DEBUG=1` is set**, so an unfiltered run (plain `vitest`, "Debug ALL Test Files", or a tool that runs every project it finds) does not run every test a second time. "Debug Current Test File" sets the variable through its `env`. From a terminal, set it yourself, e.g. `$ VITEST_DEBUG=1 npx vitest run --project debug src/index.test.ts`. Without it, `--project debug` fails with "No projects were found". There is deliberately no npm script for this: setting a variable inline is not portable to Windows, and a `test:debug` script would join `npm test`.

  `.gitignore` excludes `*.debug.test.ts`. Those files also match the `unit` glob, so scratch debug tests run locally but are never committed.

After adding or changing type-level assertions, sanity-check them: break one deliberately, confirm the run fails, then revert. Vitest prints an "experimental" warning for typecheck, which is expected.

## Code style

`ci:prettier` and `ci:eslint` enforce the style, but both only look at `src`. **Markdown files are not format-enforced**, so keep them tidy by hand.

- Prettier: `printWidth: 160`, single quotes, 2-space indent, semicolons, trailing commas, always-parenthesised arrow params.
- Every file opens with a descriptive header comment.
- JSDoc on every exported symbol: a summary in third person ("Gets ...", "Checks if ...", "Represents ..."). Only `@param` and `@returns` are used, never `@example`, `@template` or `@see`.
- Internal, non-exported symbols are `_`-prefixed and still get JSDoc. ESLint's `no-unused-vars` ignores `_`-prefixed vars, args and catch bindings.
- Group sections with `// #region Name` / `// #endregion`.
- Generic parameters are `T`-prefixed and descriptive (`TArray`, `TObject`), including `infer` bindings, which must never shadow an outer parameter.
- In conditional type chains, put a `// comment` line before each branch saying what it handles, rather than a trailing comment.
- Each test file has one top-level `describe` named after its module. `it()` names are capitalised verb phrases: `it('Greets the world by default', ...)`.
- **Every `describe` callback opens with a purpose comment.** It is a `//` block on the first line inside the callback, saying _what_ is under test and _how_ it is tested. A nested `describe` says only what its parent's comment does not.
- **An `it` callback gets a comment only when its title and body do not explain why it exists.** Examples: a regression, an edge case, a test guarding a gotcha (link it: `See AGENTS.md › <gotcha title>`), or a non-obvious assertion. Never restate the title.
- Rules deliberately off: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`, `ban-ts-comment`, `no-empty-object-type`. `any` and `@ts-expect-error` are fine to use where they earn their place.

## Gotchas and known issues

- **The template's package name is not publishable.** `.template-ts` starts with a `.`, which npm rejects, so `package.json` sets `"private": true`. A project created from the template must set a valid name (lowercase, no leading `.`/`_`) and drop `private` before publishing. Also replace the placeholder `homepage`, `bugs` and `repository` URLs, the description and the keywords.
- **`npm-run-all2`, not `npm-run-all`.** The original `npm-run-all@4` validates the package name and aborts with `Invalid name: ".template-ts"`. Its maintained fork `npm-run-all2` installs the same `npm-run-all` binary without that check.
- **Relative imports in `src/` must carry an explicit `.js` extension.** `moduleResolution: bundler` lets TSC accept `./module`, and TSC does not rewrite specifiers on emit. The extensionless form then ships to `dist/`, and Node's ESM resolver rejects it (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` / `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT`). Write `./module/index.js`.
- **Never use `npm ci --ignore-scripts` here.** `unrs-resolver` (`postinstall`) and `@parcel/watcher` (`install`) rely on their install hooks to link native bindings, and skipping them risks breaking ESLint. The CI workflow uses plain `npm ci` for this reason.
- **`prepare` builds during install**, so `npm ci` compiles once and `ci:build` compiles again. The duplicate build costs about a second and is accepted.
- **The real Node floor is 22.13.0 / 24.0.0**, not the bare major versions. It is set by `vitest@5`, `vite@8` and `eslint-visitor-keys@5`, and Node 20 is not supported. `actions/setup-node` with `node-version: 22` resolves to the latest 22.x and satisfies this.
- **Do not add an `engines` field for the dev-toolchain Node floor.** It would restrict consumers for no reason.
- **`files: ["dist"]` is an allowlist.** Anything else that must ship has to be added there. Check with `npm pack --dry-run`.
- **The `exports` map seals deep imports.** Only `.` and `./package.json` resolve, so `<package>/dist/<module>/index.js` fails under `node16`/`nodenext`/`bundler`. A new module only needs re-exporting from `src/index.ts`. Add an `exports` subpath only if the module should be importable on its own.
- **Do not add a `paths` alias to the tsconfigs.** TSC does not rewrite aliased specifiers on emit, so they would ship to `dist/` unresolvable.
- **Anything in `dependencies` is installed for every consumer.** Keep build, lint and test tooling in `devDependencies`.
- **`@types/node` is pinned to the lowest supported Node major** (currently `^22`), so type checking cannot silently rely on APIs newer than the CI matrix floor. `.github/dependabot.yml` ignores its semver-major updates for this reason, so bump it by hand together with the matrix.
- **`@eslint/js` must be a direct devDependency.** `eslint.config.js` imports it, and since ESLint 10 `eslint` no longer pulls it in transitively.
- **`tsconfig.build.json` excludes test files**, so `npm run build` never reports a type error in a test. Use `npm test` (the `unit` project type checks them) or `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.
- **`src/index.ts` only prints when run directly.** It compares `import.meta.url` against `process.argv[1]`, so importing it (from tests, or as a dependency) has no side effect, which keeps `sideEffects: false` truthful.
- `.gitignore` ignores `.vscode/` but re-includes `settings.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json` and `extensions.json`. Any other `.vscode/` file must be re-included there before it can be committed. `.gitignore` also ignores anything matching `*.gitignore.*` / `*.gitignore/`, a convention for keeping local scratch files and directories next to the code.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci && npm run ci` on every pull request targeting, and every push to, `master` or `develop`. It runs across a Node matrix of `[22, 24]` with `fail-fast: false`, and cancels in-progress runs only for pull requests, never for `master`.

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens weekly npm and github-actions updates against `develop`. devDependencies are grouped into one pull request, and `@types/node` majors are ignored.

**A workflow alone does not block merges.** To make it mandatory, set up branch protection on `master` in the GitHub repo settings, with `CI / Node 22` and `CI / Node 24` as required status checks. That is a repo setting, not a file in this repository.

## Exports

Everything public is re-exported from `src/index.ts`:

- `hello(name?: string): string` (`src/index.ts`): gets a greeting for the given name, defaulting to `'World'`.
